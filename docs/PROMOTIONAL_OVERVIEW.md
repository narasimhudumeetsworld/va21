## Frequently Asked Questions

### General

**Q: Is VA21 OS free?**  
A: Yes, VA21 OS is free to use. See the [LICENSE](../LICENSE) for details.

**Q: Can I use VA21 OS as my daily driver?**  
A: VA21 OS Alpha is suitable for testing and feedback. We recommend waiting for the stable release (V1.0) for daily production use.

**Q: What's the difference between VA21 OS and Ubuntu?**  
A: VA21 OS is built on Debian and adds triple-AI security, FARA compatibility, knowledge vault, developer toolkit, and intelligent memory management. Ubuntu is a general-purpose distribution without these specialized features.

### Technical

**Q: Does VA21 OS require internet?**  
A: Initial installation requires internet to download components. After installation, VA21 OS operates fully offline (localhost-only).

**Q: Can I run VA21 OS in a VM?**  
A: Yes! Docker and VirtualBox are supported. Minimum 4GB RAM recommended for VM.

**Q: Does VA21 OS work with NVIDIA GPUs?**  
A: Yes, NVIDIA proprietary drivers are supported. GPU acceleration is used for AI inference when available.

**Q: Can I dual-boot with Windows?**  
A: Yes, VA21 OS can be installed alongside Windows or other operating systems using standard dual-boot setup.

### Security

**Q: Is VA21 OS more secure than Qubes OS?**  
A: Different security models. Qubes uses hypervisor-based isolation (very secure but resource-heavy). VA21 OS uses AI-powered threat detection with lightweight sandboxing (practical security on modest hardware).

**Q: Does Guardian AI send data to external servers?**  
A: No. Guardian AI operates entirely localhost. Zero telemetry, zero external connections.

**Q: How do I verify VA21 OS hasn't been tampered with?**  
A: GPG signatures and checksums are provided for all releases. See [INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md) for verification instructions.

### AI

**Q: Which AI model should I use?**  
A: Start with Phi Mini (lightweight, 1.4GB RAM). Upgrade to IBM Granite or Meta LLaMA for advanced features. Dynamic AI Manager automatically selects the best model for each task.

**Q: Can I use my own custom AI models?**  
A: Yes! Ollama integration supports custom models. Plugin architecture (coming in Beta) will make this even easier.

**Q: Does the AI spy on me?**  
A: No. All AI inference happens locally. No data leaves your machine. Guardian AI is air-gapped from sensitive information.
