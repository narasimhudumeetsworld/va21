Privacy Policy for VA21 Omni Agent
Last Updated: August 28, 2025

Thank you for using VA21 Omni Agent ("the Application"). Your privacy is the highest priority. This Privacy Policy explains our commitment to protecting your data.

The Core Promise: Your Data is Yours

The fundamental design principle of this Application is zero data collection. We do not collect, store, or have access to any of your personal data or content.

1. Data Storage and Processing

All of your data, including any files you process, conversations you have with the AI, and indexes created for the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, are stored exclusively on your local computer. This information never leaves your device and is never sent to or stored on any server controlled by the developers of this Application.

2. Anonymous Analytics and Usage Data

The Application does not collect any anonymous analytics, telemetry, or usage data. We do not track which features you use, how often you use the app, or any crash reports. We have no way of knowing how you use the Application after you have downloaded it.

3. Third-Party Service Integrations

The Application allows you to connect to third-party services to enhance its functionality. These services include:

Google (for services like Gmail, Google Drive, and the Gemini API)

GitHub

Ollama (if you choose to configure a local or remote instance)

When you authorize the Application to connect to these services, you are subject to their respective privacy policies. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third-party services to understand how they handle your data. The Application only acts as a client to access these services on your behalf and does not store your credentials or the data retrieved from them on any external server.

4. Changes to This Privacy Policy

If this policy is updated, the new version will be made available within the Application's official repository or website.

5. Contact Us

As we do not collect any of your personal information, we do not have a way to contact you. For any questions about this Privacy Policy, please refer to the documentation in the project's official repository.
